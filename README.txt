## NFT Contract 

## Description

In this project we attempted to create an NFT Contract for an NFT Marketplace. However, we were unable to fully get the contract to work due to errors we could not fix. We
tried our best to get the code to work in hopes we could continue to use the contract in order to build an actual marketplace with a web page.

## Technologies

# This project is written with the programming language solidity and created on Remix. We worked in the 0.8.7 compiler and above. The contract also uses a couple of 
the openzeppelin imports. The project was written on the Windows operating system.

##Imports

import '@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol';
import '@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol';

---

##Conclusion
In conclusion we were not able to get the contract to work but hopefully after working on it some more we will be able to implement it in the future.
